Learn JavaScript by making a bookmarklet that will destroy half of the elements on your page at random -- balanced as 
all things should be. This fun little workshop is geared to a beginner-intermediate level, but the content will change 
depending on the group's level and individual attention may be given. The teacher will be Expedia's very own software engineer,
[Carlos Andr√©s Giraldo](github.com/marcianoskate).

You will be learning
- Introduction to JavaScript (variables, functions, data types, loops, etc.)
- Introduction to the DOM
- Browser manipulation
- What is a bookmarklet
