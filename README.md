# Perfectly balanced, as all things should be

This bookmarklet is an attempt at making something useful with a very basic knowledge of javascript
and supporting technologies.

We'll start easy, from basic functionality on the browser to eventually manipulating and finally 
making the page perfectly balanced. What is that you want to make perfectly balanced is up to you.

## 1) Having a working bookmarklet

1. Create a new bookmarklet
2. Give it a name, it doesn't matter what
3. In the Location (firefox) or ULR (Chrome), type the following:
    ```javascript
    javascript:(function(){
    
        alert('hello world');
    })();
    ```
1. If all went right, once you click on your newly create bookmark you should see something like this:
    ![hello world alert](docs/1.make_it_work/1.hello_world.png)
    
This might be restricted by your browser. Make sure to enable.
